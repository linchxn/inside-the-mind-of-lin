### *What is Creative Computing?*

"Creative computing" is a relatively new term that describes the intersection of the creative arts and computing, in which contemporary computational skills are applied to the (*digital*) creative industries.
As we become more reliant on technology, it becomes increasingly exclusive to those at the top of the hierarchy and in positions of power. A creative approach to computing technology can make it more accessible and piques the curiosity of those who previously had little or no interest. I came into this project with minimal interest in computing and little prior experience; through tools like TinkerCAD, physical computing became easier to understand thanks to the well-designed guides, and visual depictions of circuit simulations. If something as simple as this can improve my grasp of computing and make it more accessible to me, consider the possible innovations that creatives can bring to the computing community and to others outside of it.
>*We as creatives have the potential to bridge the knowledge gap between the elites.*

<h3><em>Reflection on physical computing</em></h3>
<p>On Monday’s Creative Computing workshop, we were first challenged with wiring up an LED using the Arduino kits. I was able to complete the circuit using online resources to aid me through the process. I briefly have experience with circuits throughout my secondary studies, thus the exercise served as a refresher in the fundamentals of physical computing. Nonetheless, the activity provided me basic knowledge and understanding of how physical computing and the Arduino hardware function. As I managed to complete the circuit first, I was able to assist my peers with their own circuits. We figure out what went wrong and how to solve it together. This was an effective community-building exercise, as it prompted people to reach out for help and communicate.</p>
<p>Using the physical and digital Arduino kits, I experimented and accomplished various projects independently over the week. With the completion of various projects, I was able to have a better grasp of how technology operated within our environment; how the basic circuits I built are also utilised in everyday electronic systems like automated doors and light sensors. It also got me thinking about how some elements/functions of these projects' can be incorporated into the “interactive light” from my Unit 1 project. What I believed to be too difficult and advanced could become a reality.<p>

### *Interactive Light* 
</p>
<p>We developed a prototype that will <strong>DETECT</strong> and <strong>DISPLAY</strong> data from its surroundings. <br> This was part of my Unit 1 project, which included an “<strong><em>Interactive Light/Lamp</strong></em>” as one of the intervention options. The device will detect its environment using a variety of parameters and will display a colour light that corresponds to the data it has collected. The changing colours will visually representation the data acquired. It was through the Arduino projects that I discovered this is achievable; using numerous components that can monitor noise levels, motion/movements, temperature, and people's moods. The device will then calculate the overall atmosphere of the shared space by combining parameters and data results. Through this whole process it will then emit a single coloured LED light that reflects the mood of its surrounding.</p>
<h6>NOISE LEVEL:<h6>
<p>The noise level is likely be the most vital factor, as differing noise levels is associated with a specific atmosphere of the environment. As a result, noise levels would be used to determine the atmosphere of the environment. <br> The spectrum of noise, in fact, can be utilised to represent a variety of atmosphere/mood preferences.</p>
<h6>MOTION/MOVEMENT:<h6>
<p>A lively mood might be indicated by a lot of activity. <br>
No motion, on the other hand, can indicate a quiet atmosphere as well as the absence of anyone.</p>
<h6>TEMPERATURE:<h6>
<p>An increase in the temperature of the surrounding area can suggest that there are a lot of people in the area. <br>
Furthermore, a change in temperature may indicate that there are activities (or no activities) taking place in the shared space.</p>
<h6>MOOD:<h6>
	<p>Moods and emotions can be manually entered by individuals or groups.</p>
